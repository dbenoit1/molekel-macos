DISTRIBUTIONS

     Precompiled executables:
     If not stated otherwise the executables are statically linked
     with the GLUT, MUI and GLUI libraries. Therefore, they
     don't need to be installed extra. On the other hand, a
     OpenGL/Mesa and libtiff installation is required. 
     If you prefer to link with other versions of third party objects
     or shared objects of other packages, download the object files
     and relink your own MOLEKEL executable


INSTALLATION

The precompiled executable distribution contains the following
files: 

     molekel/bin/molekel         the molekel script:
                                 adjust paths depending on your installation

     molekel/bin/molekel*.arch   the molekel executable: platform dependent 

     molekel/lib/LICENSE         license information

     molekel/lib/README          this instruction

     molekel/lib/atoms.data      text file with atom type data

     molekel/lib/help.txt        currently a dummy

     molekel/lib/ms              the executable of Connolly's molecular
                                 surface program

     Unzip and unpack molekel*.tar.gz (gzip -cd molekel*.tar.gz |
     tar -xvf -) to anywhere. 
     either 
         move the files in molekel/bin to /usr/local/bin, then
         rehash. 
         move the folder molekel/lib to /usr/local/lib/molekel. 
     or 
         adjust the paths in the script molekel 
         add the location of the script to the path, rehash, or
         define an alias. 
     On Win9x/NT unpack the distribution to any place. Copy
     glut*.dll from the GLUT distribution to the
     C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 folder for a general installation
     or to the folder where molekel lives. 

To relink with other versions of third party objects or shared objects
of other packages do the following: 

     Unzip and unpack molekel-objects*.src.tar.gz (gzip -cd
     molekel-objects*.src.tar.gz | tar -xvf -) to anywhere. 
     cd to molekel/objects. 
     copy the Makefile of your platform (e.g. "cp
     Makefile-objects.sgi-n32 Makefile"), adjust the paths in the
     Makefile. 
     type "make", the executable "glutmolekel" will be generated. 
     rename glutmolekel appropriately (e.g. molekel*.sgi-n32). 
     Some libraries which might not be on your system by default
     are required to relink MOLEKEL: 
         OpenGL: check with your vendor if available for your
         system 
         or Mesa: can be downloaded from http://www.mesa3d.org/
         If OpenGL is available for your system, performance is
         usually better compared to Mesa. 
         GLUT, the OpenGL Utility Toolkit: can be downloaded from
              http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/glut3.html 
         MUI: is part of the GLUT distribution 
         GLUI (Version 2.1): can be downloaded from http://www.cs.unc.edu/~rademach/glui/
         GLUI is distributed under the GNU Lesser General
         Public License. 
         libtiff: can be downloaded from http://www.libtiff.org/tiff-v3.5.5.tar.gz
         libjpeg: can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg
         libimage: can be downloaded from
                   https://toolbox.sgi.com/toolbox/src/haeberli/libimage/index.html#dl
                   (only needed if "-limage" is present in your Makefile) 

MOLEKEL makes use of an adapted version of the tr library by Brian Paul
(http://www.mesa3d.org/brianp/TR.html), is part of the MOLEKEL distribution.
